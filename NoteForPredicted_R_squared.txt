Use predicted R2 to determine how well the model predicts responses for new observations.
Larger values of predicted R2 indicate models of greater predictive ability.

Predicted R2 is calculated by systematically removing each observation from the data set, estimating the regression equation,
and determining how well the model predicts the removed observation.
Predicted R2 ranges between 0 and 100% and is calculated from the PRESS statistic.

Predicted R2 can prevent over-fitting the model and can be more useful than adjusted
R2 for comparing models because it is calculated using observations not included in model estimation.
Over-fitting refers to models that seem to explain the relationship between the predictor and response variables for
the data set used for model calculation but fail to provide valid predictions for new observations.
