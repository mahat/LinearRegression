# LinearRegression
Linear Regression Examples

# Simple Linear Regression
- One Independent and Dependent variable
- Conducting statistical test for linearity
- Out of sample prediction
- Plots for results

# Multivariate Linear Regression 
- Multiple independent variables, One dependent variable
- Checking linearity of variables
- Checking co-linearity
- Iterative model approach
- Creating and interpreting results of models

# Categorical Linear Regression
- Introducing dummy variables
- Conducting iterative model approach by dealing dummy variables
- Creating and interpreting results of models

# Utils
- In Utils.py, you can find Predicted R-Squared code and standard error of estimates calculations.
- Good explanation of Predicted R-Squared is made by minitab documents and you can find it in NoteForPredicted_R_squared.txt

# Running Code
- Code is writen in Python 2.7.12. 
- Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels and Matplotlib libraries are used
- If you install Scipy stack, probably you will have all of libraries that are used.
